  Getting started with speckle can be approached from several directions: either as an end user, where you just want to send data and geometry around, as a developer wanting to build on top of speckle, or as a maintainer deploying a server for your company or group.

  # Taking Speckle For a Spin {.font-weight-thin-xxx .my-4}

  In order to use speckle, you will need to have some authoring software installed on your computer. We currently have integrations for Grasshopper, Dynamo, Rhino, and a WIP Revit client - either of those should do. It also helps to have a friend next to you, as it's much more fun to send data to each other rather than play ping-pong alone!

  ### The Speckle Clients Installer {.font-weight-thin-xx .my-4}

  You can install the latest release of [the clients from here](https://github.com/speckleworks/SpeckleInstaller/releases/latest). If you're curious about new features, you can always try out the [pre-release channel](https://github.com/speckleworks/SpeckleInstaller/releases/). Once the installation is succesful, you should be able to open the speckle plugins the software you've installed it for.

  ### Getting Started Guides {.font-weight-thin-xx .my-4}

  We currently have a guide only for Dynamo and Grasshopper.
