  <!-- <div class='font-weight-light'> -->

    Good news everyone! Together with [Buro Happold](http://burohappold.com), [3D Repo](http://3drepo.org), [Rhomberg](https://rhomberg-sersa.com/en/home/) and [UCL The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/construction/), we've won a grant to make the construction industry better and faster at sending and managing design data. As part of this consortium, UCL is opening a Research Fellow position.

    Mostly, the focus on this grant will be to standardize and normalize a so called "delta" format - ie, change specifications for design data updates. You will work both on schema definitions (not IFC, don't worry!), but also many other aspects of speckle: the server, client implementations, front-end, etc. You will have a certain freedom in choosing this. Alongside this, you will get to travel to conferences üå¥, talk and learn and enjoy academic working hours üòé. You will be working with data from real projects and case studies üèó, and essentially shape the future of digital communication infrastructure for the AEC world. What more do you want?

    <!-- # What we're looking for: {.font-weight-thin .mb-2} -->

    If you're familiar with the [speckle stack](https://github.com/speckleworks), or parts of it, you're good to go. Piecemeal, this means:

    <v-card class='pa-3 my-4'>

    - NodeJS and MongoDB on the backend
    - VueJS (vuex, vuerouter) & ThreeJs on the frontend
    - Patience for [OpenApi](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) Specification writing
    - .NET C# for most of the speckle clients
    - Devops & CI/CD is a big bonus

    </v-card>

    Frankly, we're not pretentious. Good ideas that can get delivered in other ways are always welcome, so feel free to tell us in what direction you want to move and we'll see if we can make it work. It's important to keep in mind that speckle is an open source project, and you will work within this wider context - albeit on more targeted problems.

    So what are you waiting for? <a href="https://atsv7.wcn.co.uk/search_engine/jobs.cgi?SID=amNvZGU9MTc4ODU1NiZ2dF90ZW1wbGF0ZT05NjUmb3duZXI9NTA0MTE3OCZvd25lcnR5cGU9ZmFpciZicmFuZF9pZD0wJnZhY3R5cGU9MTI3NiZwb3N0aW5nX2NvZGU9MjI0">Apply now!</a>
