## Intro {.headline .font-weight-thin .my-4}

The domain name for Speckle.Works was registered around March 2016. This means the end of 2017 catches us approximatively 9 months into speckle's life. As some of you may know, this is not _really_ accurate - this incarnation of speckle is built on lessons learned in the three previous ones: [speckle.xyz](http://speckle.xyz), [beta speckle](http://beta.speckle.xyz) and [speckle streams](http://streams.speckle.xyz), with the first going back to late 2015.

Below is a roundup of the last few months. This is not, by all means, an exhaustive list! There's many rumblings and churns, most of it geared towards a better user space and some technical debt elimination (coupled with, obviously, introduction of new technical debt).

## Rhino Plugin {.headline .font-weight-thin .my-4}

There has been a lot of work going towards the Rhino Plugin (5 & 6), which now needs some final polish before release. Code is shared, and in theory it should be workable on Rhino for Mac with minimal changes.

Furthermore, since the UI is a completely separate layer based on VueJS (yes, in .NET! running in a browser!), bits and pieces could be used to jumpstart development for other CAD platforms - kudos to Luis for having the courage to embark us on this road!

So far, it looks good and it feels good: we hope this will entice people in the future to share and parcel their data. Some of us don't scale well on Grasshoppers.
